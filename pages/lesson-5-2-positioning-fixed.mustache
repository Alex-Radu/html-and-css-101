  <h2>Bohemian Rhapsody</h2>
  <br />
  <p>Is this the real life?</p>
  <p>Is this just fantasy?</p>
  <p>Caught in a landslide,</p>
  <p>No escape from reality.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Open your eyes,</p>
  <p>Look up to the skies and see,</p>
  <p>I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy,</p>
  <p>Because I'm easy come, easy go,</p>
  <p>Little high, little low,</p>
  <p>Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Mama, just killed a man,</p>
  <p>Put a gun against his head,</p>
  <p>Pulled my trigger, now he's dead.</p>
  <p>Mama, life had just begun,</p>
  <p>But now I've gone and thrown it all away.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Mama, ooh,</p>
  <p>Didn't mean to make you cry,</p>
  <p>If I'm not back again this time tomorrow,</p>
  <p>Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Too late, my time has come,</p>
  <p>Sends shivers down my spine,</p>
  <p>Body's aching all the time.</p>
  <p>Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go,</p>
  <p>Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Mama, ooh (any way the wind blows),</p>
  <p>I don't wanna die,</p>
  <p>I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all.</p>
  <br />
  <p>I see a little silhouetto of a man,</p>
  <p>Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?</p>
  <p>Thunderbolt and lightning,</p>
  <p>Very, very frightening me.</p>
  <p>(Galileo) Galileo.</p>
  <p>(Galileo) Galileo,</p>
  <p>Galileo Figaro</p>
  <p>Magnifico-o-o-o-o.</p>
  <br />
  <p>I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me.</p>
  <p>He's just a poor boy from a poor family,</p>
  <p>Spare him his life from this monstrosity.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?</p>
  <p>Bismillah! No, we will not let you go. (Let him go!)</p>
  <p>Bismillah! We will not let you go. (Let him go!)</p>
  <p>Bismillah! We will not let you go. (Let me go!)</p>
  <p>Will not let you go. (Let me go!)</p>
  <p>Never let you go (Never, never, never, never let me go)</p>
  <p>Oh oh oh oh</p>
  <p>No, no, no, no, no, no, no</p>
  <p>Oh, mama mia, mama mia (Mama mia, let me go.)</p>
  <p>Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me.</p>
  <br />
  <p>So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?</p>
  <p>So you think you can love me and leave me to die?</p>
  <p>Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby,</p>
  <p>Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here.</p>
  <br />
  <p>(Ooooh, ooh yeah, ooh yeah)</p>
  <br />
  <p>Nothing really matters,</p>
  <p>Anyone can see,</p>
  <p>Nothing really matters,</p>
  <p>Nothing really matters to me.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Any way the wind blows.</p>
